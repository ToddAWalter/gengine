// A line extends infinitely in two directions.
//
// Because a line is infinite, the definition of "t" is somewhat unclear:
//  - t = 0 is always the start point (p0)
//  - Positive t extends in direction from p0 to p1
//  - t is a percentage of the distance between p0 and p1
// In a lot of cases, it probably makes sense to have p1-p0 be a unit vector, but sometimes not!
