// GK3 somehow internally knows what is or isn't a valid actor in the game.
// Thus far, I have't been able to find any data file that specifies this data. Possibly, it is hard-coded in the game's source code.

// To get around this, I have created this mapping manually that'll be loaded at game launch and used to verify actors.
