// Various nodes that are used in constructing animations.
//
// Animations proceed over time, executing each "frame" as enough time passes.
// Each frame can have one or more "animation nodes" associated with it.
// When a frame is executed, all associated animation nodes are executed.
// Each node can do something such as: play a vertex animation, trigger SFX, change face textures, lip sync, etc.
