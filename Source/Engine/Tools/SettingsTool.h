// A tool that displays additional game settings/options.
//
// This version of GK3 may want to expose options that weren't available in the original game.
// However, adding those options to the "real" in-game menu is difficult and would make the experience feel less like the original game.
// The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to expose additional options while leaving the game's UI mostly unchanged.
