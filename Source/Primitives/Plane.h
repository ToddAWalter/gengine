//
// A plane in 3D space. A plane extends infinitely, dividing 3D space into two halves.
//
// A plane is defined with the equation "n dot p + d = 0". This means:
// 1) A plane can be represented by its normal n and its distance d.
// 2) Entering a point p calculates if the point is on the plane, in front of the plane, or behind the plane.
//
// Another way to think of a plane is the surface defined by three non-colinear points (a triangle).
//
// This code assumes that the normal is, well, normalized. When this is true,
// distance equates to the distance of the plane from the origin.
//
// The distance can be signed, and the effect is not exactly intuitive.
// When distance is zero, the plane is at the origin of the coordinate system.
// As distance increases, the plane moves opposite the direction of the normal (resulting in normal facing origin for positive values).
// As distance decreases, the plane moves in direction of the normal (resulting in normal facing away from origin for negative values).
